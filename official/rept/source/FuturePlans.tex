\chapter{Future Plans}

As it is, this is a solid design, and ready to be delivered. As the full board can
be assembled almost entirely by automated pick-and-place, these can be delivered as
a prepared package, or they could be delivered as kits with components and an
assembly guide.

However, we recommend simultaneously beginning a second revision. The drawbacks
mentioned in the Assessment should be corrected. Additionally, the BOM cost could
be lowered in a few areas, such as replacing expensive wideband operational
amplifiers with transistor amplifiers, or even possibly redesigning the
synthesis subsystem to avoid using the purpose-specific DDS integrated
circuit (it might be possible to use a relatively high speed FPGA, at a
reduction of about half the cost).

Additionally, the PC software can be enhanced. More analysis functions can be
written, and the software could be made to integrate with existing packages such
as Octave.
