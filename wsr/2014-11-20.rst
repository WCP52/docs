Harrison Owens
--------------

- Hour spent: 

  + Group meeting: 5 hours
  + Firmware( Writing + testing ) : 3 hours
  + Interim Report: 3 hours
  
- Accomplishments:
  
  + Successfully tested SPI interface
  + Understood how to efficently test SPI interface with logic analyzer
  
- Problems:

  + Test for synthesizer board unsuccessful 
  + Not too involved this week in firmware development due to focus writing report
  + The initial design report is not too coherent
 

- Plans:

  + Hopefully brainstorm some ideas for testing software
