Chris Pavlina
-------------

- Hours spent:

  + Detector_ PCB: 4 hours
  + `ADC characterization`_: 0.5 hour
  + Preparing architecture presentation: 3 hours
  + `Input coupling design`_: 3 hours

- Accomplishments:

  + Completed ADC INL characterization

- Problem:

  + RF switch sample is late. Solution: characterize switch this weekend

- Plan:

  + Complete switch characterization as soon as switch is available
  + Complete input coupling/filter/detector board by Monday

--------------
-Hours Spent:
  + ADC characterization : 30 mins
  + SPI testing : 1 hour
  + SPI research : 2 hours
  
- Accomplishments
  + With the team successfully characterized ADC on ATSAM4S16C
  + successfully tested output of SPI interface on ATSAM4S16C
    
- Current Problems:
  + Did not put the time into writing out my own code which would get me used to coding process of microcontroller
  + Should have put more time into understanding what the SPI is really interacting with in the Microcontroller
    
- Plans:
  + To Create my own code for the microcontroller in order to test it better
