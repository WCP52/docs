WCP52: Weekly Status Report
===========================
Week of 2014-11-07

---------------

Chris Pavlina
-------------

- Hours spent:

  + Detector_ PCB: 4 hours
  + `ADC characterization`_: 0.5 hour
  + Preparing architecture presentation: 3 hours
  + `Input coupling design`_: 3 hours

- Accomplishments:

  + Completed ADC INL characterization

- Problem:

  + RF switch sample is late. Solution: characterize switch this weekend

- Plan:

  + Complete switch characterization as soon as switch is available
  + Complete input coupling/filter/detector board by Monday

Harrison Owens
--------------
- Hours Spent:

  + `ADC characterization`_ : 30 mins
  + SPI testing : 1 hour
  + `SPI research`_ : 2 hours
  
- Accomplishments:

  + With the team successfully characterized ADC on ATSAM4S16C
  + `successfully tested output of SPI interface`_ on ATSAM4S16C
    
- Current Problems:

  + Did not put the time into writing out my own code which would get me used to coding process of microcontroller
  + Should have put more time into understanding what the SPI is really interacting with in the Microcontroller
    
- Plans:

  + To Create my own code for the microcontroller in order to test it better

Kenneth Zach
------------
- Hours Spent:

  + FA meeting : 1 hour
  + `ADC characterization`_ : 30 minutes
  + `SPI research`_ : 1 hour
  
- Accomplishments:

  + Successfully tested ADC.  

- Problems

  + Not enough time to get more work done this week, but we are not behind schedule.
  + Will have plenty of time to get work done this weekend to make up for this week.
  
- Plans

  + Research more SPI
  + Learn about implementing SPI on our dev board
  + Possibly writing some code for it to be tested on Monday

Kaidi Xu
-------------
- Hours spent:
  
  + Meeting:1.5 hours
  + ADC characterization: 30 minutes
  + SPI research: 30 minutes

- Accomplishments:
  
  + Finish testing ADC and make it success

- Problems:
