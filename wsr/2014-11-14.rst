Harrison Owens
--------------

- Hours spent:
 
  + SCPI command program testing: 1 hour
  + Reading & Researching Datasheet for Synthesizer chip: 1 hour
 
- Accomplishments:

  + Tested simple code to communicate with the terminal
   
- Problems:

  + None
   
- Plan:

  + Work with Ken to program the synthesizer chip once it is built.
  
Kenneth Zach
------------

- Hours Spent:
   
   + Command parsing: 1 hour
   + Studying datasheet for synthesier chip: 1.5 hours
   + Studying Atmel's SPI example code: 1 hour
   + Writing wiki on what needs to be sent to synthesizer using SPI: 30 mins
   
- Accomplishments:

  + Wrote about half of what we need on the wiki
  + Gained a pretty good understanding of Atmel's SPI code
  + Learned how to parse commands entered into the terminal
  
- Problems:

  + datasheets? more like datashits
  
- Plan:
  
  + Finish the wiki - it will explain everything that needs to be communicated to the synthesizer
  + Write the code that sets up the synthesizer.
    + Do this in a way that we can enter what we want to set in the synthesizer through the terminal, this way each SPI transfer can be verified with a logic analyzer before we get the synthesizer
